## 🧹 Data Cleaning
Performed in **Excel** using filters, formulas, and formatting tools:
- Removed duplicate rows and blank records.
- Checked and corrected spelling inconsistencies (e.g., Gender or Region).
- Converted data types where required (e.g., Income → Number, Age → Number).
- Ensured categorical values were standardized (e.g., “M” → “Male”, “F” → “Female”).

Key pivot tables created:
- **Purchases by Gender and Marital Status**
- **Average Income by Purchase Decision**

- **Purchases by Age Group**
- **Purchases by Region**
- **Education Level vs Bike Purchase**

These helped explore which **customer segments** were more likely to purchase a bike.
